     Minimal Car Rental T & C
----------------------------------

[Booking and pickup]
Required documents: You must present a valid driver's license (often a physical card is required, not electronic) and the name on the license must match the name on the credit or debit card.
Minimum age and experience: There is a minimum age and driving experience requirement, with some companies imposing age restrictions or additional requirements for older drivers.
Credit/Debit card: A valid major credit or debit card is required to hold a security deposit (hold) for potential extra charges. Debit card usage may have additional requirements.
Confirmation: A booking request does not guarantee a car; a reservation is only confirmed after the company has accepted it.
Pickup: You are responsible for collecting the vehicle on time. Late pickups may result in a cancellation of the reservation without a refund.

[Renter responsibility]
Vehicle condition: You are deemed to have inspected and accepted the vehicle as being in good condition at the start of the rental.
Security: You are responsible for the vehicle's security, including keeping keys safe, and minimizing the risk of theft or vandalism.
Driving rules: You must not repair the vehicle without prior authorization. You must also use the correct grade of fuel and must not drive on unsealed roads if the vehicle is not permitted to.
Fines and tolls: You are responsible for all fines, tolls, and other penalties incurred during the rental period. The company may pay these for you and charge you the amount plus an administrative fee.
Theft and accidents: In the event of theft or an accident, you must report it to the police and the rental company. You must be able to provide the police report to the company to ensure any applicable waivers remain valid.

[Payment and fees]
Rental charges: You agree to pay the specified rental fees and any additional charges that arise during the rental period.
Security deposit: A hold for a security deposit is placed on your credit or debit card at the start of the rental to cover potential extra charges.
Additional products: Optional products like Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) or other waivers have their own terms and conditions and may not cover all types of damage or loss.
Fuel: The fuel policy will be specified. Many companies require the vehicle to be returned with a full tank, and you may have to pay for the initial fuel at a non-refundable rate if you do not refuel it yourself before returning.

[Cancellation and changes]
Cancellation policy: There are specific conditions for cancellation. You may be charged a fee or lose a portion of your payment if you cancel within a certain timeframe before the pickup date.
Modifications: Any changes to the rental agreement (like the rental period, pickup location, etc.) must be made with the consent of the rental company.
Vehicle return
Return instructions: You must return the vehicle by the agreed-upon time and location and follow the company's specific return instructions.
Late returns: Returning the car late can result in extra charges.
